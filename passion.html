                    <p>Where to start, as important as it is to make time on a day to study, learn, and be better it’s even more important to do something that will de stress your head and make you start fresh every time you'll get back to the desk.</p>
                    <p>I've been a long time gamer and sportsman all my life, since I was around 12 years old I played World of Warcraft and when I wasn't killing moster's or enemy player's I was playing basketball.</p>
                    <p>As I grew older I stopped enjoying the endless grind of mmo's and I grabbed a game called League of Legends which you start over every time you play a game so it's not as time consuming, and whenever I want to get that WoW’s vibe there's a great game called Path of Exile that fills that void without having to invest that much time on it.</p>
                    <p>Nowadays when I'm not playing game's I've discovered that not only eating good is something that I've always loved but also cooking! Reading books, following tutorials on internet or even videos I've learned a great deal of dishes and cooking skills I couldn't even imagine possible. Can't start talking about this topic without making a 5 pages long essay so we'll leave it at <strong>cooking rocks!</strong></p>
