                <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>I've always played with the idea of coding, programming, web design or however you want to call it. </p>
                    <p>Somehow even if it interested me and got me to take peak on that foreign world.. Every time it grabbed my attention there was something dull about just writing endless line's of code on a web editor just to get a site to opearte that really made me end up quitting.</p>
                    <p>With time and a lot of thought I've realized that actually programming and coding is not really what we're here for but what can you make with it, just as a painter is not in his profession for a cute looking paint pen or an architech just fell in love with a bevel.</p>
                    <p>When you're making a website you're giving life to a concept, to what was before just an idea and if you can't see the beauty on that then there's nothing else I can say to make you understand my decission on becomming a full time web designer!</p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>I'm being very straightforward with my goals this year, right now I have an objective that’s to get my <em>techdegree</em> as a <strong>F</strong>ront <strong>E</strong>nd <strong>W</strong>eb <strong>D</strong>eveloper so I can start getting a job as a junior web developer!</p>
                    <P>Currently working hard to get good at:</P>
                        <ul class="skills">
                            <li class= skills-html>HTML</li>

                            <li class= skills-javascript>JavaScript</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>As of now I speak three languages, and I might get a course on a new one as every person you can communicate with it's a new world that can open up for you!</p>
                    <p>Right now I've mastered:</p>
